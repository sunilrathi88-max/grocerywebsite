## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Review and Merge PR #30

1. Navigate to: https://github.com/sunilrathi88-max/grocerywebsite/pull/30
2. Review the changes in the "Files changed" tab
3. Verify the PR description and checklist
4. If everything looks good, approve and merge the PR into `main`
5. Use "Squash and merge" or "Create a merge commit" as preferred

### Step 2: Close Remaining PRs

After PR #30 is merged, close the following PRs with appropriate comments:

#### Close PR #29 - "Fix TypeScript errors, security vulnerabilities, and remove debug code"
**Comment:**
```
Closing this PR as the changes have been consolidated and merged via PR #30 (copilot/close-pull-requests).

All TypeScript fixes, security updates, and code quality improvements from this PR are now in the main branch.

Thank you for the comprehensive fixes! ✅
```

#### Close PR #28 - "Fix critical build error and image loading issues"
**Comment:**
```
Closing this PR as the TypeScript/build errors are now resolved via PR #30.

The critical build error (duplicate ClockIcon) and related issues have been fixed through the comprehensive TypeScript updates.

The application now builds successfully with 0 errors. ✅
```

#### Close PR #26 - "Add comprehensive image fallback handlers"
**Comment:**
```
Closing this PR as the application's current image handling is functional.

While the fallback approach is valuable, the main build and functionality issues have been resolved through PR #30. If specific image fallback improvements are needed in the future, they can be addressed in a new focused PR.

Thank you for the contribution! ✅
```

#### Close PR #25 - "Fix image loading by replacing external URLs with data URIs"
**Comment:**
```
Closing this PR as it overlaps with other image-related improvements and the current implementation.

The critical TypeScript and build errors have been resolved via PR #30. The application is now functional with proper image handling.

If additional image placeholder standardization is needed, it can be addressed separately. ✅
```

#### Close PR #24 - "Standardize all image placeholders with branding"
**Comment:**
```
Closing this PR as a cosmetic/branding improvement that can be addressed separately if needed.

The critical functionality and build issues have been resolved via PR #30. If brand consistency for placeholders becomes a priority, this can be revisited in a new PR.

Thank you for the branding work! ✅
```

#### Close PR #22 - "Complete video link audit and fix build error"
**Comment:**
```
Closing this PR as the build error has been fixed via PR #30.

## Summary Statistics

## Additional Notes

### Why Consolidation Was Necessary

Multiple PRs were addressing overlapping issues:
- **Build/TypeScript errors**: Addressed by PRs #22, #28, and #29
- **Image handling**: Addressed by PRs #24, #25, #26, and #28
- **Contact info**: Addressed by PR #21

PR #29 provided the most comprehensive solution for TypeScript/build issues, so it was chosen as the base for consolidation.

### Future Recommendations

1. **Establish Branch Protection**: Require PR reviews before merging
2. **Create Contribution Guidelines**: Help prevent overlapping PRs
3. **Use Issue Templates**: Better track what each PR addresses
4. **Regular PR Reviews**: Prevent accumulation of draft PRs
5. **CI/CD Integration**: Automated testing before merge

## Questions?

If you have questions about any of these closures or the consolidated changes, please:
1. Review the PR_CONSOLIDATION_SUMMARY.md file in this repository
2. Check the FIXES_SUMMARY.md for detailed fix documentation
3. Open a new issue for any concerns
