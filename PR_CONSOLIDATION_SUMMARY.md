### ⚠️ PR #28 - Fix critical build error and image loading issues with fallback support
**Status:** SUPERSEDED by PR #29
**Branch:** copilot/fix-all-issues-and-images

**What it addressed:**
- Duplicate ClockIcon declaration fix
- Image loading error handling

**Analysis:**
This PR attempted to fix build errors and image issues, but:
- PR #29 already fixes the TypeScript/build errors more comprehensively
- The image fallback approach in PR #28 is less complete than later PRs
- This was an earlier iteration before the more comprehensive fixes

**Recommendation:** CLOSE as superseded by PR #29 and the comprehensive TypeScript fixes.

---

### ⚠️ PR #26 - Add comprehensive image fallback handlers
**Status:** PARTIAL - Some approaches valid
**Branch:** copilot/vscode1760872174985

**What it addressed:**
- Image error handling with fallback placeholders
- Uses inline SVG data URIs for fallbacks

**Analysis:**
- Good approach using data URIs
- However, this is a subset of what's already working in main
- No critical functionality missing without this PR

**Recommendation:** CLOSE as the main application already has functional image handling. If specific image fallback improvements are needed, they can be addressed in a new focused PR.

---

### ⚠️ PR #25 - Fix image loading by replacing external URLs with data URIs
**Status:** OVERLAPPING with PR #24 and #26
**Branch:** copilot/vscode1760870271438

**What it addressed:**
- Replace external placeholder URLs with data URIs
- Created centralized constants file

**Analysis:**
- Similar approach to PR #26
- Overlapping with PR #24's branding changes
- The current codebase already handles images appropriately

**Recommendation:** CLOSE as redundant with other image-related PRs and current functionality.

---

### ⚠️ PR #24 - Standardize all image placeholders with branding
**Status:** COSMETIC IMPROVEMENTS
**Branch:** copilot/vscode1760868578275

**What it addressed:**
- Standardized placeholder colors (F8E3D9/333333)
- Added "Tattva Co." branding to all placeholders

**Analysis:**
- This is primarily a cosmetic/branding improvement
- Not critical for functionality
- Could be applied later if branding consistency is desired

**Recommendation:** CLOSE for now. If brand consistency for placeholders is important, create a new focused PR after main issues are resolved.

---

### ✅ PR #22 - Complete video link audit and fix build error
**Status:** INFORMATIONAL - Already Fixed
**Branch:** copilot/audit-video-links

**What it addressed:**
- Audited Pexels video links (all working)
- Fixed ClockIcon duplicate declaration
- Added VIDEO_AUDIT_REPORT.md

**Analysis:**
- The ClockIcon fix is already addressed by PR #29
- Video audit shows no issues (all links working)
- Documentation is valuable but not critical

**Recommendation:** CLOSE as the build error is already fixed by PR #29. The video audit found no issues.

---

### ✅ PR #21 - Update contact information links
**Status:** FUNCTIONAL UPDATE
**Branch:** copilot/validate-contact-info-links

**What it addressed:**
- Updated email to ssunilrathi88@gmail.com
- Updated phone to +918890006364
- Added CONTACT_LINKS_VALIDATION.md

**Analysis:**
- This contains actual functional updates to contact information
- Changes are valid and should be preserved
- Independent of other PRs

**Recommendation:** MERGE if the contact information is correct, otherwise CLOSE if contact info doesn't need updating.
