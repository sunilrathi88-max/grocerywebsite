        <h3>1. Returns</h3>
        <p>We have a 30-day return policy, which means you have 30 days after receiving your item to request a return. To be eligible for a return, your item must be in the same condition that you received it, unopened or unused, and in its original packaging.</p>

        <h3>2. Refunds</h3>
        <p>We will notify you once we’ve received and inspected your return, and let you know if the refund was approved or not. If approved, you’ll be automatically refunded on your original payment method. Please remember it can take some time for your bank or credit card company to process and post the refund too.</p>
        
        <h3>3. Damages and Issues</h3>
        <p>Please inspect your order upon reception and contact us immediately if the item is defective, damaged or if you receive the wrong item, so that we can evaluate the issue and make it right.</p>

        <h3>4. Contact Us</h3>
        <p>If you have any questions about our Refund Policy, please contact us at support@tattvaco.com.</p>
