**Solution:** Created missing `components/icons/ClockIcon.tsx` file and removed duplicate definition

---

## Recommendations

### ✅ No Action Required for Video Links
The current Pexels video implementation is working correctly and does not require any changes:

1. **Pexels videos are reachable** - The platform is stable and operational
2. **Videos play correctly** - Browser testing confirms proper functionality
3. **No 404 or similar errors** - All video URLs are valid
4. **Good performance** - Videos are served from Pexels CDN

### Optional Improvements (Future Enhancements)

If you want to enhance the video experience in the future, consider:

1. **Error Handling Enhancement**
   - Add fallback behavior if a video fails to load
   - Display an error message or fallback image
   - Implement retry logic for failed video loads

2. **Loading States**
   - Add loading spinner while video is buffering
   - Show video duration information
   - Display download progress

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Consider lazy loading videos (only load when modal opens)
   - Add poster images for faster perceived load times
   - Implement adaptive bitrate streaming if needed

4. **Accessibility**
   - Add captions/subtitles if videos contain spoken content
   - Ensure keyboard navigation works properly
   - Add ARIA labels for screen readers

5. **Self-Hosting Option**
   - If you want more control, consider hosting videos on your own CDN
   - Could use services like Cloudflare R2, AWS S3, or similar
   - This would eliminate dependency on third-party platforms

## Code Quality

### Video Implementation Location
- **File:** `App.tsx` (lines 41-69)
- **Usage:** `components/ProductDetailModal.tsx`

### Implementation Quality
- ✅ Videos are properly integrated into product data structure
- ✅ Video player component handles both images and videos

## Conclusion

**The video links are working correctly and do not return 404 errors.** The issue description mentioned Google Drive links that are not present in the codebase. The actual implementation uses Pexels, which is a reliable and professional solution for stock videos.

**No critical issues were found.** The only issue discovered was a build error (duplicate ClockIcon declaration) which has been resolved.

**Recommendation:** Close this issue as the videos are functioning properly, or update the issue description to reflect that the project uses Pexels instead of Google Drive.
